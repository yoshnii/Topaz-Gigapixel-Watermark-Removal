# Topaz-Gigapixel-Watermark-Removal
In the free trials of Topaz Gigapixel AI, the output image retains the original quality but includes a large watermark in the center. This recorded set of Photoshop commands allows users to remove the watermark and have a clear image.

To use these commands, open Photoshop, go to the 'Window' menu, select 'Actions', then click on the icon at the top right corner of the Actions panel, and choose 'Load Actions'. Select the .atn file. Next, open the output image from Topaz Gigapixel AI, select 'Action 1', and initiate the action by clicking the triangle icon at the bottom of the Actions panel. This should now give a clear image.

This straightforward set of commands targets the watermark area, adjusts the curves to match the color tone between the watermark and the rest of the image.
